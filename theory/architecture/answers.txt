1. The three file read functions were fscanf, fgets, and fread. They differ in how much and what they get from the file. fscanf looks for a string which follows the format of some format string, and then splits the string to the different parts of the format. This is a good function to use when trying to parse numbers from a file. fgets reads up to a newline character or EOF character. This function is good for reading one line at a time. fread reads however many characters you tell it to or until it reaches the end of the file. This is a good default read function for when you don't need any of the features of the other two. 
2. Memory on the stack is reclaimed at the end of the function where the memory was allocated. Memory on the heap isn't reclaimed until the end of the program unless it is manually freed by the programmer.
3. No functionality is lost without structs. The functionality of structs can be replicated by making an object with only getter and setter methods. That is essencially the same thing as a struct.
4. Object-like programming is possible in C. You can use a struct for all the data and simplly pass the struct as a parameter to functions to immitate methods.
